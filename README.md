# **AI-Powered Resume Analyzer**

**Created & Developed by:** [Greeshmanth Basivi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greeshmanth-basivi-44030a382/)

The AI Resume & Job Match Analyzer is a modern, full-stack web application designed to help job seekers evaluate their resume against a specific job description. By uploading a resume and pasting the job text, users receive an instant percentage-based match score and a highlighted list of keywords that are present and missing, providing a clear overview of lexical alignment.

## **‚ú® Features**

* **User-Friendly Interface**: A sleek, responsive, and modern UI with dynamic animations for a professional user experience.  
* **Versatile File Upload**: Seamlessly extracts text from both **PDF** and **DOCX** file formats.  
* **NLP-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes an advanced NLP engine with **spaCy** for text preprocessing, including lemmatization and stop-word removal.  
* **Accurate Match Score**: Calculates a precise, percentage-based similarity score using **scikit-learn's** TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity algorithms.  
* **Intelligent Skill Gap Analysis**: Moves beyond simple keyword counting by automatically categorizing key terms from the job description into:  
  * **Technical Skills** (e.g., Python, SQL, AWS)  
  * **Soft Skills** (e.g., Communication, Teamwork)  
  * **Action Verbs** (e.g., Developed, Managed, Analyzed)  
* **Actionable Feedback**: Clearly highlights which crucial skills are present in the resume and which are missing, empowering users to make targeted improvements.
